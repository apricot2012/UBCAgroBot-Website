# UBC AgroBot Website

This is the Github Pages repo for the official website of UBC AgroBot, [ubcagrobot.com](https://ubcagrobot.com).

## Information About Website

This is a one-page styled website with information about the AgroBot Team. It includes our progress, goals, competitions, and how to sponsor us. It also has a few blog-style pages that are updates of our current progress. 

I used a bootstrap template, *crystal by UIdeck* while designing this website, making use of its modules and effects while creating the content.

The website is hosted on Github Pages, and is linked to the domain ubcagrobot.com.

## Maintainance information

The content of the homepage of the website is in index.html. The linked images are in the /img subfolder, the blog pages are in the /blog subfolder, and the css styling is in the /css subfolder.
