# UBC AgroBot Website

This is the Github Pages repo for the official website of UBC AgroBot, ubcagrobot.com.

## Information About Website

This is a one-page styled website with pictures and information about the AgroBot Team, our progress, goals, competitions, and how to sponsor us. It also has a few blog-style pages that are updates of our current progress. 

I followed a free-to-use bootstrap template, crystal by UIdeck while designing this website, utilizing a lot of its modules and effects while creating the content in html, css and js.

The website is hosted on Github Pages, and is linked to the domain ubcagrobot.com.
